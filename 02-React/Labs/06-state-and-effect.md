1. Open Students\06-state-and-effect and run `npm install`.

2. There are 4 exercises to work through.

- The import on line 5 of `index.tsx` should be the exercise you're working on.
- There are instructions in the files - the first one is in exercises/exercise1.js.
- These are mostly refactor tasks, work through the instructions and check it still works (or works better)
- Check the relevant solution and then move onto the next exercise by changing the import statement.
