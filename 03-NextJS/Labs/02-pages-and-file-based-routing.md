# Routing Project

1. Open up the starter project and run npm install.

2. Setup placeholder pages for the following routes:
	- / -> Starting page (show featured events)
	- /events -> Events Page (show all Events)
	- /events/<some-id> -> Event detail page (show selected event)
	- /events/...slug -> Filtered events page (show filtered events)

3. Add the dummy data to your project and supplementary images.

4. Add featured items to your home page with `<Link>` components to the event. You might get the data with a useEffect hook? 

5. On the individual page, show the data about the event (maybe just `JSON.stringify`? Or a fuller component?)

- Add a styling library and create a component for a single event.
